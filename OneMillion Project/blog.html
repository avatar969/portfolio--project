                <p>Choreography is the art or practice of designing sequences of movements of physical bodies in which motion or form or both are specified. Choreography may also refer to the design itself. A choreographer is one who creates choreographies by practising the art of choreography, a process known as choreographing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Choreography is the art of making dances, the gathering and organization of movement into order and pattern. Most recent works of Western theatre dance have been created by single choreographers, who have been regarded as the authors and owners of their works in a way comparable to writers, composers, and painters.<br>
                Most social and recreational dances, on the other hand, are products of long evolution, involving innovations that groups of people or anonymous individuals have brought to traditional forms. This evolutionary process is also typical of much non-Western choreography, where both the form and steps of dances are handed down from one generation to another and subject only to gradual and partial change. Even in cultures where it is common for dancers and dancing masters to create their own variations on existing dances, as among the Hopi in northeastern Arizona, it may not be traditional to honour an individual as a particular dance’s creator.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The methods by which different choreographers create their work also vary. Some work closely with the dancers from the beginning, trying out ideas and taking suggestions from the dancers themselves before pulling all of the material together. Others start with clear ideas about the shape of the piece and its content even before going into the studio. The 19th-century choreographer Marius Petipa used small models to work out the groupings of his dances. The amount that any choreographer can do without dancers is limited, because the notation of dance is relatively undeveloped.</p>
